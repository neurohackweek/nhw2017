## Code of Conduct

Neurohackweek is dedicated to providing a harassment-free learning experience for everyone
regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation,
disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. We do not
tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is
not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks. Conference
participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the
conference without a refund at the discretion of the organizers.

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:
- Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to
  gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion.
- Sexual images in public spaces
- Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
- Harassing photography or recording
- Sustained disruption of talks or other events
- Inappropriate physical contact
- Unwelcome sexual attention
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, the organisers
retain the right to take any actions to keep the event a welcoming environment
for all participants. This includes warning the offender or expulsion from
Neurohackweek with no refund.

Neurohackweek organisers may take action to redress anything designed to, or
with the clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the environment hostile
for any participants. We expect participants to follow these rules at all the
event venues and event-related social activities.

Harassment and other code of conduct violations reduce the value of
Neurohackweek for everyone. If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or
unwelcome, please report it as soon as possible to one of [the instructors](http://neurohackweek.github.io/#instructors). You can make a report
either personally or anonymously. Anonymous reports can be made at
